Cult of the Buttplug is a simple BepInEx based mod for [Cult of the Lamb](https://www.cultofthelamb.com/) on PCs.

_Note: While CotB may work in Proton environments, it has only been tested on Windows._

## Features

- Vibrate on damage to Player
- Vibrate on damage to Enemies
- Allow Follower Interaction that causes vibration

As I am not sure anyone is actually going to use this mod, the feature list is short for the moment, but can easily be expanded. Let me know if there's more features you'd like to see!
